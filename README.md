## Building rustc-estros

Personal fork of rustc targeting `aarch64-estros` (bare-metal aarch64),
shipped as a normal tier-2 target with std.

### Nix package (hermetic, offline)

    nix build .#default

Stage-2 toolchain (rustc + rustdoc + std) lands in `./result`, with
`aarch64-estros` as a regular target. Network is confined to a fixed-output
vendoring derivation.

### Dev shell (fast iteration on std)

    nix develop -c ./x build --stage 1 --target aarch64-estros library

Builds just std for `aarch64-estros` in the working tree (non-hermetic:
CI LLVM + incremental). Fastest loop for editing the estros std PAL.

### Check the target

    ./result/bin/rustc --print target-list | grep estros
    ls $(./result/bin/rustc --print sysroot)/lib/rustlib/aarch64-estros/lib/ | grep libstd

### Compile a test binary

    ./result/bin/rustc --target aarch64-estros hello.rs -o hello-estros
    file hello-estros
    # ELF 64-bit LSB executable, ARM aarch64, statically linked

## Why Rust?

- **Performance:** Fast and memory-efficient, suitable for critical services, embedded devices, and easily integrated with other languages.

- **Reliability:** Our rich type system and ownership model ensure memory and thread safety, reducing bugs at compile-time.

- **Productivity:** Comprehensive documentation, a compiler committed to providing great diagnostics, and advanced tooling including package manager and build tool ([Cargo]), auto-formatter ([rustfmt]), linter ([Clippy]) and editor support ([rust-analyzer]).
